        <h3>Elite Events entire wedding was a success because of Akushla and her team! Thank you very much for being an amazing coordinator and for doing such a great job with the decorations.
            Many guests gave wonderful comments about the garden and reception hall decor. When I walked down the aisle, I was stunned to see what Akushla has done with the garden and when I walked into the reception hall i was even more amazed.
            A big thank you to Akushla and her team. You helped us in every little detail and coordinated the entire event so smoothly even to the extent of negotiating with wedding vendors. The team was extremely supportive when my dress was a mess and very helpful to our families and other vendors. Thank you for taking care of everything</h3>

        <h3>I couldn’t have better things to say about working with Akushla and her team. Throughout the planning process, Aku was attentive, organized and resourceful. She introduced me to amazing vendors, organized visits and attended every vendor meeting. On our wedding day, I knew I had absolutely nothing to stress about because Aku and her team were on it. Every little detail, every step of the way.

 

            I couldn’t have asked for a better planner, and am so grateful that we picked Akushla to help us throughout our wedding planning. I would recommend Akushla and her team to absolutely anyone!</h3>
